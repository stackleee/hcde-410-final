# Understanding Funding Disparities and Student Outcomes in Tacoma Public Schools

# Abstract
This study explores the impact of funding disparities on student outcomes within Tacoma Public Schools. By analyzing quantitative data, including education equity scores and student performance metrics (e.g., test scores, graduation rates, and post-secondary enrollment rates), alongside qualitative insights from interviews and community forums, the research highlights significant inequities between schools in lower-income and higher-income neighborhoods.

Key findings indicate that higher-funded schools consistently achieve better outcomes in English assessments, graduation rates, and post-secondary enrollment. However, no significant relationship was observed between funding and math performance, warranting further investigation. Qualitative data provided valuable context, emphasizing the role of facilities, extracurricular opportunities, and demographic factors in shaping educational experiences.

This study underscores the urgent need to address systemic funding disparities to ensure equitable educational opportunities for all students. Future research should explore broader qualitative perspectives and develop actionable solutions to mitigate these inequities.

# Project Overview
This final project examines the relationship between funding disparities across high schools in the Tacoma Public School District and student outcomes. I will analyze student test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment rates to determine if such a relationship exists. By incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data, I aim to gain a deeper understanding and uncover the truth behind my hypothesis: that high schools within the Tacoma Public School District with higher funding levels achieve better student outcomes than those with lower funding levels.

The goal is to shed light on the disparities faced by students in lower-income neighborhoods and advocate for equitable educational opportunities for all students, regardless of socioeconomic background.

# Research Questions
1. How does the funding vary across the high schools within the Tacoma Public School District?
2. What is the relationship between the funding of schools and student outcomes (e.g., test scores, graduation rates, and next institution enrollment rates)?
3. Are there any specific areas where disparities are most apparent?

# Methodology
This project combines quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a holistic understanding of the issue:

# Data Sources:

## Quantitative Data:
1. Tacoma Equity Index 2020, used as a proxy for funding levels.
2. Tacoma Public Schools student outcome data, including metrics such as test scores and graduation rates.

## Qualitative Data:
1. An interview with a former Tacoma Public Schools student provided personal insights into resource allocation and its impact on educational experiences.
2. Supplementary insights from online forums like Reddit were reviewed for anecdotal evidence.
Analysis Techniques:

## Quantitative:
Descriptive statistics, visualizations (bar and scatter plots), and a T-test to examine statistical significance.

## Qualitative:
Analysis of interview responses and forum discussions to identify key areas of disparity.

# Key Findings
**Funding Variability:** Funding levels vary significantly across high schools, with stark differences between schools in higher-income and lower-income neighborhoods.
**Impact on Student Outcomes:** Higher funding correlates with better outcomes in English assessment scores, graduation rates, and post-secondary enrollment rates.

Surprisingly, math performance showed no clear relationship with funding, indicating the need for further investigation.

# Specific Areas of Disparity:
Facilities and resources were the most apparent disparities, with lower-funded schools struggling to maintain infrastructure and offer extracurricular activities.

## Limitations
**Sample Size:** The qualitative analysis is based on a single interview, which may not fully represent the diversity of experiences in Tacoma Public Schools.
**Focus on Equity Index:** The use of the Equity Index as a funding proxy may oversimplify the complexities of resource allocation.
Future Directions

**To deepen this research, future work could:**
Conduct more interviews and focus groups with students, teachers, and administrators to provide diverse qualitative perspectives.
Investigate other factors influencing outcomes, such as teaching quality, community support, and curriculum differences.
Propose actionable solutions to address disparities, focusing on policies and programs that ensure equitable access to resources for students in lower-income neighborhoods.
